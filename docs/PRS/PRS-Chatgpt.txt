**Notes:**

* Each module is **independent, pluggable, and testable**.
* Switching markets only requires **data feed and broker adapter changes**.

## **5. Functional Requirements**

### **5.1 Core Engine**

* Accepts standardized input: market data, account state, environment.
* Returns standardized output: BUY/SELL/HOLD, position size, stop-loss, take-profit.
* Runs multiple models simultaneously per market.
* Supports two modes: advisory and operator.

### **5.2 Multi-Market Operations**

* Crypto, Forex, Stocks (future).
* Each market has **independent risk rules and models**.
* Market switch requires only adapter change.

### **5.3 Backtesting & Simulation**

* Historical backtesting with configurable periods.
* Walk-forward testing.
* Monte Carlo simulations.
* Real-time paper trading with identical pipeline to live trading.

### **5.4 Risk Management**

* Global and per-market risk profiles.
* Max drawdown limits, daily loss limits.
* Position sizing and leverage control.
* Emergency shutdown and manual override.

### **5.5 Broker/Exchange Integration**

* Abstracted API adapter per broker/exchange.

    cancelOrder(orderId: string): boolean
    getMarketData(symbol: string): MarketData
}
```

If you want, I can **also draw a detailed visual architecture diagram** showing all modules, adapters, and data flows, suitable for sharing with the development team. This will make it much easier for developers to understand the architecture at a glance.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
