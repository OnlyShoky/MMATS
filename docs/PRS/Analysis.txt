- **Future-ready**: Explicitly addresses AI/LLM integration (Section 5.3) with practical architecture (message bus, pluggable design)
- **Environment parity**: Emphasizes identical pipeline across backtest/paper/live (Section 2.2 "Pipeline Parity")
- **Realistic scope**: Clearly distinguishes Phase 1 limitations vs. future capabilities

#### **3. Superior Modularity (9/10)**
- **Clean Architecture**: Explicitly follows Clean Architecture and Hexagonal patterns
- **Well-defined ports**: Clear adapter pattern for DataFeed, Execution, Persistence, UI
- **Market agnosticism**: Section 2.2 states "Core engine processes normalized data objects"
- **Strategy agnosticism**: Strict `IStrategy` interface ensures plug-and-play models
- **Future AI module**: Section 5.3 describes AI as "separate service/container" with message bus integration

#### **4. Excellent Feasibility (9/10)**
- **Pragmatic phasing**: 5-phase roadmap (11 months) with realistic monthly milestones
- **Technology recommendations**: Appendix B mentions specific stack (Python, FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL/QuestDB, Redis)
- **Local-first deployment**: Section 10 prioritizes Docker Compose for personal use before cloud
- **Incremental approach**: Phase 1 starts with single market, Phase 3 adds second market

#### **5. Strong Risk & Compliance (8/10)**
- **Hierarchical risk framework**: Section 7 clearly defines Global → Market → Strategy → Trade rule cascade
- **Hard gatekeeper concept**: "RiskManager is a hard gatekeeper; any signal failing a rule is rejected"
- **Circuit breaker**: FR-R5 mandates emergency flatten-all-positions capability
- **Security depth**: SEC-1 through SEC-6 cover encryption, least-privilege, audit logs, environment isolation
- **Legal awareness**: LEG-1 through LEG-5 address personal use, broker TOS, disclaimers, market manipulation

#### **6. High Practicality (9/10)**
- **Immediately actionable**: FR-S1 through FR-U5 are testable, measurable requirements
- **Clear interfaces**: Section 6 provides Python code for `IStrategy` interface
- **Standardized objects**: Defines `MarketData`, `AccountState`, `TradeSignal`, `TradeResult` structures
- **15-minute config goal**: NF-R6 states "configure a new strategy and market within 15 minutes"

### **Weaknesses**

#### **1. Testing Strategy Limited**
- **No dedicated section**: Unlike Claude PRS, lacks comprehensive testing requirements
- **Coverage mentioned**: NF-R4 states 80% target but doesn't specify unit/integration/E2E approach
- **No validation methodology**: Missing backtest validation, walk-forward details, Monte Carlo specifics

#### **2. UI/UX Underspecified**
- **High-level only**: FR-U1 through FR-U5 describe what to display but not how
- **No wireframes or mockups**: Lacks visual guidance for developers
- **Dashboard details**: Doesn't specify chart libraries, real-time update mechanisms, or responsive design

#### **3. Monitoring & Observability Gap**
- **Logging mentioned**: NF-R2 requires logging but doesn't specify structured logging, log levels, or retention
- **No alerting**: Missing notification channels (email, Telegram, SMS)
- **No metrics**: Doesn't define KPIs, dashboards (Grafana), or observability stack

#### **4. Data Management Incomplete**
- **Storage mentioned**: Appendix B lists PostgreSQL/QuestDB but lacks schema design
- **No data retention**: Missing policies for historical data, log rotation, backup schedules
- **Limited data validation**: Doesn't address data quality, outlier detection, or gap handling details

#### **5. Innovation Moderate (7/10)**
- **AI section good**: Section 5.3 provides solid AI integration architecture
- **But less visionary**: Compared to Claude's detailed LLM sentiment pipeline, this is more abstract
- **Missing advanced features**: No mention of Monte Carlo specifics, cross-market arbitrage, or ML optimization

### **Missing Elements**

1. **Comprehensive testing strategy**: Unit, integration, E2E, performance, security testing
2. **Detailed UI specifications**: Screen layouts, workflows, user journeys
3. **Monitoring & alerting**: Metrics, dashboards, notification channels
4. **Data schemas**: Database design, data models, migration strategy
5. **Error handling patterns**: Retry logic, circuit breakers (execution layer), graceful degradation
6. **Performance benchmarks**: Specific latency targets beyond "< 500ms end-to-end"
7. **Deployment procedures**: CI/CD pipeline, rollback strategy, zero-downtime updates
8. **Disaster recovery**: Backup frequency, restoration procedures, RTO/RPO targets

### **Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Add Section 12: Testing Strategy**
   - Unit testing with pytest (80% coverage target for core)
   - Integration testing with testnet APIs
   - End-to-end scenario testing (backtest validation, paper trading runs)
   - Performance profiling and load testing
   - Security testing (penetration testing, dependency scanning)

2. **Expand Section 3.6: User Interface**
   - Add wireframes or ASCII mockups for key screens
   - Specify chart library (TradingView Lightweight Charts)
   - Define real-time update mechanism (WebSocket)
   - Add responsive design requirements

3. **Add Section 9.5: Monitoring & Observability**
   - Define metrics collection (Prometheus)
   - Specify alerting rules and channels
   - Include log aggregation strategy (ELK, Loki)
   - Define dashboards (Grafana)

4. **Expand Section 10: Deployment & Infrastructure**
   - Add CI/CD pipeline specification
   - Define environment promotion (dev → staging → prod)
   - Include rollback procedures
   - Specify backup and disaster recovery

5. **Add Section 13: Data Management**
   - Database schema design
   - Data retention policies
   - Migration strategy
   - Backup schedules and procedures

6. **Enhance Section 5.3: Future AI Module**
